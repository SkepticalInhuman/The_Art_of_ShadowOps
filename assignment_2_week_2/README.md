1.Contains logistic regression function from sklearn and a custom logistic regression function. Both models are trained on the iris dataset. The iris dataset is a datset corresponding to iris flower species, has 4 input features, 3 target classes and 150 observations.
2.Initially iris dataset was loaded and split into train and test data. Logistic regression function from sklearn was then fit onto the training data. The accuracy was obtained by running the trained model on the test data. 100% accuracy was obtained.
Custom Logistic_regression class is then defined. _init_is the constructor of the class and initializes the object with 2 parameters 'learning_rate' and 'iterations'. Softmax function is then defined and weights and bias is set to zero with size equal to the input data.'self.k = len(np.unique(y))' determines the number of unique classes. One-hot encoding of the labels is performed to facilitate gradient computation. The loop is then run for the number of iterations specified. Linear combination of input features and weights plus the bias term is calculated, softmax is then applied to get the predicted probabilities. Gradient with respect to weights and bias is calculted and the weights and bias is then updated using gradient descent. predict function computes linear model, apllies softmax and returns the class with highest probability. 100% accuracy was obtained.
